.. Databench documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Overview
========

Databench is a Python package that you can install using 

.. code-block:: bash
	
	pip install git+https://github.com/svenkreiss/databench.git

It provides an executable ``databench`` and the Python module ``databench`` as well as a JavaScript library for the frontend with the same name. A good way to start is to jump right into :ref:`quickstart`.

To look at some example analyses, there is a gallery of `live demos`_. The live demos do not include examples with parallelization or database interfaces (like asynchronously subscribing to a Redis channel) but those examples are available in the `databench_examples`_ repository.
